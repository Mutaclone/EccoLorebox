[Chatty Circle]
1.) Ecco! It's me! Remember? I helped you in the tunnels of teeth!
1.) We don't understand how, but since you left it's been as if our eyes have been opened. We realized we are in danger.
1.) Find the Prime Mover, she can explain everything! HURRY!

[Glyph No. 1]
1.) Cage is a prison protecting both sides.

[Adult Pilot]
1.) Ecco! You made it! I knew you would!
1.) Something strange happened after you disappeared. Do you feel different? I do!
1.) My mom is looking for you. Talk to her, you must see her!

[Glyph No. 2]
1.) Never the same one. Twice in sequence. Red. Green. Red with green. Blue with yellow. One with no colors. Blue with yellow. And no colors again.

[Prime Mover]
1.) Ecco! Something happened since last we saw you. One moment we were as dumb as animals, then we were not!
1.) But this intelligence has made us aware of how little we understood! And now we are in grave danger!
1.) You are within part of some horrible weapon built by man. It is no Engine of Salvation, but an Engine of Death!
1.) There are others who can explain the parts I do not understand. Please find them and help us all!

[Lone Crimson]
1.) I sense we have you to thank for the intelligence that has come to us, Ecco. But it comes perhaps too late.
1.) I am now able to understand the icons that surrounded me my entire life. They tell the terrible truth of man.
1.) Man brazenly left the Earth and encountered a deadly foe. Man built the great weapon here to combat this foe.
1.) But man and the Foe destroyed one another before the weapon could be completed.
1.) If this unfinished weapon activates, it will destroy everything!
1.) You must reach the heart of the machine and prevent it! You are our only hope, Ecco!

[Glyph No. 3]
1.) Blue and yellow that is all. No more colors must you turn. Seek new paths in well known places and one last place where waters rise.
