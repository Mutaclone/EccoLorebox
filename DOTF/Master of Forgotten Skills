1.) This place is spooky. I bet no one's been here since mankind left us.

2.) Let's find something to do.

3.) I wish my mom and the others were here to see this place!

4.) Maybe some day I can find a Labor Harness and be just like you!

After discovering the boxes in the bottom of the seafloor.
5.) Just a bunch of boring boxes. And only one of them has anything in it!

6.) These boxes are boring. Let's look at something else.

After talking to the Glyph.
7.) Who are you singing to? I don't see anything! Are you talking to yourself?

When you find the bulldozer on the platform.
8.) The thing on that platform looks like it should be able to move. Try singing to it!

When you discover the floating switch.
9.) Maybe you should try singing to the floating thing.

When you turn on the floating switch.
10.) Look! You made the big thing move!

When the bulldozer is removed from the platform and placed it to the seafloor.
11.) You moved that thing from the platform to these boxes, but now what? Maybe you should sing to it and see what happens.

After singing to the bulldozer.
12.) I think you have to use the rolling thing to push a box of rocks to that big door.

1.) The harness makes your song control the works of man. The floater rules the crane. The dozer moves the carts. The full one opens doors.
