[Resistance Outcast Member No. 2]

[Outcast Elder]
1.) Not long ago, I found this strange glowing sphere in the cavern. I thought it was beautiful, but was afraid to touch it.
1.) At first I guarded it selfishly. But the more I was around it, the more I found myself thinking of others.
1.) I brought others here so they could share this experience. But the Clan learned of it, and I was captured.
1.) The Clan say that they have a sphere and demanded ours too. Fearing what they would do with it, I refused to talk.
1.) So they punished the village hoping someone would talk, but my friends hid here, safe from their interrogations.
1.) We will show you our globe. Perhaps you can help us understand it.

2.) Come! There is a way you might get to the globe the Clan has! Follow me closely, the way is not easy, and only I can help you get through!
