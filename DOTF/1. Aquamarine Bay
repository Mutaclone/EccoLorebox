[Elder Common Dolphin]
Start of the tutorial
1.) Greetings Ecco! You are young and eager, but if you will listen to a wise old dolphin like me, maybe I can teach you some new things!
1.) If you wish to talk, just point your bottle nose at me and use your sonar!

2.) Good, you know how to talk! Now let's see if you can swim just as well as you can talk!
2.) Pump with your flipper to accelerate or hold down to keep a steady pace. Once you stop pumping, you will slow down gradually. Try it now!

3.) Nice fluid tailwork there! But can you charge as well?
3.) Charging will give you extra speed, you can go faster and jump higher than you would think possible.
3.) Charging is also the way you catch your prey, the fish! Just aim your nose at a school of them and charge right in the middle of them. Go try it!

4.) Hey! Easy with that charge! You might hurt someone friendly. Charging is also used as a weapon against your enemies but never ever point your nose at your friends unless you want to talk!
4.) Now try a special maneuver: the quick turn! You can do it left or right to turn around in an instant! Give it a try!

5.) Good job! Turning around quick may give you an edge when it comes to fighting enemies.
5.) Now another special trick! Not all dolphins are able to master it, but I know you can. Swimming Backwards!
5.) Use it as a brake to slow down and stop in a instant. When you have stopped, use it to swim backwards! Can you master this one?

6.) You are a quick learner, Ecco! You have mastered all the basic skills a dolphin should know! Now it is time for fun!
6.) Let's see if you can tailwalk! Just slowly peek your nose above the surface of the water. When you can feel the breeze start pumping with your tail.
6.) You can tailwalk around for a long time and see things not visible from underwater. Go try it and have fun!

End of the tutorial
7.) You are the most talented dolphin I have met, Ecco! There is nothing else I can teach you today.
7.) But I can give you advice which will serve you well: observe and remember and you will live long my friend!

[Vitalit]

1.) You have found a vitalit! With each vitalit collected, the amount of health you can possess will grow incrementally.

[Mother Humpback Whale]

1.) Hello Ecco! Feel those waves! The tide is really strong, we can't get into Atlantis today. But it's such a beautiful day out here anyway.

2.) Were you here to see the guardian send the explorers on their way? It was magnificent!

After talking to her baby.
3.) I see you talked to my baby. All she does is talk about you. Sometimes I think she'd rather be a dolphin than a whale!

4.) The tide is too strong to swim against, so we're just enjoying the waves. The way to Atlantis will be clear when the tide starts to rise again.

After the earthquake.
5.) Ecco! Thank goodness you are here! My baby is missing! I can hear her crying for help but she is nowhere in sight!

[Baby Humpback Whale]

1.) Hello Ecco! I would love to see you do some of those tricks! Show me how high you can jump!

After jumping around and doing tricks.
2.) I always tell my mother that when Ecco charges out of the water, he jumps higher than any dolphin around!

3.) I love to watch you do your tricks!

4.) Can you do a lot of tricks while in the air and jump really really high?

5.) I like to watch you tumble and roll when you jump! Do that again!

6.) I want to do those midair flips that you do. I wish I was a dolphin!

7.) You are the best jumper there is!

After the earthquake.
8.) Ecco, help! I'm stuck behind the rocks!

9.) Get help! Hurry!

[Guardian Glyph]

1.) Earthquake destroyed me and our world is in danger. I am in need of your help and will guide you to me.
1.) This is only your first test of many. Save the child whale and the great one will help you past the falling water.
