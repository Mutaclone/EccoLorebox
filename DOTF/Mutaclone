1.) The intruder at last! I knew you would reach me, despite your being everything we believe to be weak and inferior.
1.) Your success makes me wonder what kind of world you come from, and what would result if you touched the prize I protect.
1.) Perhaps a better world? Perhaps not. I CANNOT RISK EVERYTHING I KNOW FOR THE SAKE OF CURIOSITY!
1.) So, sadly, your brave quest ends here. Farewell, Ecco!

[Glyph]
1.) Only real pain is real danger. Only real danger is real enemy.
