[Glyph No. 1]
1.) Path guarded by terror and no one will pass safely. Its eyes are of lightning so you must stay concealed.

[Glyph No. 2]
2.) The monster is behind you but its curse lays in front. Two pairs of the six holes will drain power of yours.
2.) Time runs against you but observance is key. Put your trust in your best friends, let them guide you to me.

[Glyph No. 3]
3.) Ancient and impressionable. Inscrutable and unknowable. With one touch you become one, with the next one you touch.
NOTE: This is what the wise pale dolphin from Four Ways of Mystery (named location being referred as "Cave of Secrets") was referring to.
